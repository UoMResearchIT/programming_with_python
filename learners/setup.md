## Overview

This lesson is designed to be run on a personal computer.
All of the software and data used in this lesson are freely available online,
and instructions on how to obtain them are provided below.

## Install Python

In this lesson, we will be using Python 3 with some of its most popular scientific libraries.
Although one can install a plain-vanilla Python and all required libraries by hand,
we recommend installing [Anaconda][anaconda-website],
a Python distribution that comes with everything we need for the lesson.
Detailed installation instructions for various operating systems can be found
on The Carpentries [template website for workshops][anaconda-instructions]
and in [Anaconda documentation][anaconda-install].

## Obtain lesson materials

1. Download [python-intermediate-data.zip](./data/python-intermediate-data.zip)
2. Create a folder called `swc-python` on your Desktop.
3. Move downloaded file to `swc-python`.
4. Unzip the file.

You should see a folder called `data` in the `swc-python` directory on your
Desktop.

## Launch Python Interface

We recommend following the instructions in the setup page for [Programming for Python][prog_python_course]
for launching the python interface.
