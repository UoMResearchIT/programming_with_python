Python supports a large, and growing, informal network of developers - each creating tools that are aimed at solving the needs of their research, or business, community. One of the benefits of using python is the opportunity it gives you to tap into this shared development network, to build on and use the developments that others have made.

This course is designed to introduce you to some of the different libraries and tools that are available for python. The lessons begin with a reminder of the python essentials. It then introduces the concept of JSON formatted data and dictionaries, defensive programming, numpy and matplotlib usage, how to deal with physical quantities and a short introduction to the pandas library.
